# NetStrike Game Rules

## 🎮 Overview

NetStrike is a strategic, cyber-themed card game where two players engage in a hacking battle. Each turn consists of **three phases**: the **Payload Phase**, the **Execution Phase**, and the **Purge Phase**. Players manage **CPU** and **RAM** resources to execute attacks, defenses, and utilities while trying to reduce their opponent’s **System Integrity** to zero.

---

## 🔹 Game Setup

1. Each player starts with:

   - **5 CPU** (Regenerates +3 per turn, max cap of 6)
   - **128 RAM** (Used as a threshold for playing certain cards)
   - **20 System Integrity (Health)**
   - A **deck of 20 cards**
   - An **opening hand of 4 cards**

2. Players take turns simultaneously, selecting their cards in secret before resolving actions.

3. The game ends when a player’s **System Integrity reaches 0**.

## 🔄 Turn Structure

Each turn consists of three distinct phases:

### **1️⃣ Payload Phase (Planning Phase)**

- Both players select cards to play in secret.
- Players can play **Attack, Defense, and Utility cards**, as long as they meet **CPU and RAM requirements**.
- Once both players have locked in their choices, the game moves to the **Execution Phase**.

### **2️⃣ Execution Phase (Resolution Phase)**

- All selected cards are revealed.
- Cards resolve **simultaneously**, applying effects based on their type and mechanics.
- Any damage, debuffs, or effects take place immediately.

### **3️⃣ Purge Phase (End Phase)**

- **CPU regenerates (+3 CPU, up to cap).**
- **Temporary effects expire (e.g., status effects, CPU drain, RAM reductions).**
- **Players draw cards until they have at least 4 in hand (if deck allows).**

## 💻 Resource Management

### **🔹 CPU (Processing Power)**

- Each action requires **CPU** to execute.
- Players regenerate **+3 CPU per turn**.
- The **default max CPU cap is 6**, but this can be increased via utility cards.
- If a player lacks enough CPU, they cannot play the chosen card.

### **🔹 RAM (Memory Threshold)**

- **RAM is not spent** but acts as a **threshold** to play more powerful cards.
- Players start with **128 RAM**.
- Some cards require a **minimum RAM threshold** to be played.
- RAM **can be increased or reduced** using specific effects.

## 🃏 Card Types

### **🛠 Utility Cards**

- Modify **CPU, RAM, or provide special effects**.
- Examples: **CPU Upgrade, RAM Expansion, Overclock**.

### **⚔️ Attack Cards**

- Used to **damage the opponent’s System Integrity** or disrupt their resources.
- Examples: **DDoS Barrage, Trojan Injection, Exploit Chain**.

### **🛡 Defense Cards**

- Used to **block damage, mitigate effects, or restore integrity**.
- Examples: **Firewall Patch, Intrusion Detection, Adaptive Firewall**.

---

## ⚠️ Win Conditions & Game End

- A player **wins** if their opponent's **System Integrity reaches 0**.
- If both players’ integrity hits 0 simultaneously, the game is a **draw**.
- If a player runs out of cards in their deck, they **skip drawing but continue playing**.

---

## 🚀 Additional Mechanics

- **Status Effects:** Some cards apply debuffs like **CPU Drain, RAM Loss, or Stun Effects**.
- **Card Reveal Mechanics:** Some utility and defense cards allow players to see or predict opponent’s plays.
- **Chain Effects:** Some attacks **trigger extra damage** if combined with another attack in the same turn.

---

## 🔥 Strategy Tips

- **Balance CPU & RAM Upgrades:** Investing in **CPU cap or RAM early** can enable more powerful plays.
- **Use Defense Wisely:** Blocking a **critical attack** can shift momentum.
- **Chain Attacks for Maximum Damage:** Some attack cards work best **when played together.**
